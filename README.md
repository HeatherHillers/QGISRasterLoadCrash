# QGISRasterLoadCrash
These hillshades were created from test .las data


Using the following tutorials and their associated test .las data, I have created these 4 hillshade tifs.

This data I can load in QGIS and work with without problems on a networked win32 environment.  The 4 tiles are all less than 1000 Kb.
When I try to load even the smallest of the tifs on 2.14 or 2.16 however, I get an immediate or almost immediate AppCrash.
